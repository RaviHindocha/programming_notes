Subject line -> Core Audio System Software Engineer job listing

Please find enclosed my application for the role of Core Audio System Software Engineer. I am enthusiastic to apply for this position because it combines my current professional direction and my expertise in and passion for digital audio.

For the past one and a half years I have been a full-stack software engineer at Hedvig, a cutting-edge software defined storage startup. In just over a year, I have transitioned from working mainly in client-side JavaScript through server-side JavaScript, to Python. I am currently leading a project to develop a cluster deployment and management platform for a complex distributed filesystem. 


Prior to starting at Hedvig, I earned a master's degree in Music Technology from Berklee College of Music. This experience reinforced my knowledge of the hardware, software (including Logic), and workflow of large-format digital-console-based studios and helped me to better apply this knowledge to creative music production. My work ethic and passion for learning helped me to graduate summa cum laude.

I believe I am a good candidate for this position because of my ability to rapidly learn complex new skills and theories and apply these skills in a productive and innovative ways. Most of my free time has been devoted to working with C and C++ for audio applications. I am proficient in C, C++, JavaScript, and Python, and have developed a strong working knowledge of Swift, Objective-C, Java, Ruby, and Perl. I have studied concurrency in C, C++, and Java, and have devoted much of my efforts to internalizing proper modern software development practices, drawing from the wisdom of object-oriented paradigms, functional paradigms, the latest web development practices, and design patterns for systems level engineering.


At the age of 18, I taught myself how to play the guitar. Within 3.5 years, I graduated from the University of Virginia with a double major in music and mathematics, having earned multiple awards and scholarships in the music department. After graduating, I spent the next four years playing and touring in a number of bands and musical ensembles in a range of styles. I also taught music, recorded, and built a small project studio. I am sharing this piece of personal history because I believe it demonstrates that I am invested in audio production both personally and professionally. 

I am extremely excited at the prospect of working for the Interactive Media Group at Apple.
I have the highest regard for Apple as an organization and Core Audio as a 
technology. I believe the quality of Apple's products is unparalleled in the industry.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
