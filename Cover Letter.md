Dear Hiring Manager:

I am writing to express my interest in the role of {posted position}.
I am excited to apply for this position because {}.

As a full stack engineer at Hedvig, a cutting-edge software-defined storage company,
I recently finished a cluster deployment and management platform for the entire Hedvig product.
I have repeatedly proven my ability to rapidly learn complex new software engineering-related 
subjects and apply them in productive and innovative ways. Building on skills I gained while 
earning a bachelor's degree in both mathematics and music and a master's degree in music technology, 
I have contributed to and headed projects ranging from client-side JavaScript SPAs, to server-side 
Node.js applications, to DevOps tools written in Python and Ansible. 

Additionally, from the time that I transitioned to this field professionally, I have devoted much of 
my free time to working with C++ for general purpose application development and to increase 
my knowledge and extend my capabilities as a developer. I am highly capable in C++, Python, Swift, 
and JavaScript and have developed a strong working knowledge of C, Objective-C, Haskell, Java, 
Ruby, and Perl. I have studied various topics such as computability, systems programming, and 
concurrency, and put considerable effort towards internalizing modern software development best 
practices, drawing wisdom from object-oriented paradigms, functional paradigms, design patterns, 
and optimization techniques.

I would like to bring the following strengths to your attention as I feel they closely match the
advertised job requirements:

- Web UI development 
- DevOps and Ansible 
- Server-side and scripted languages
- Testing with JavaScript test frameworks
- Project management
- Development with a range of compiled languages, including application development on a various platforms

Please find attached a copy of my resume which contains additional relevant information.
I can be reached by phone at (510) 301-1980 or by email at timothyshull@gmail.com. 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you would like to schedule an interview.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,


Timothy M. Shull, Jr.
