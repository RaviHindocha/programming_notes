Dear Hiring Manager:

Everybody has heard the stories of bad band break-ups...the Beatles, the Pixies, the Police.
I have lived through one, a tough one. Since then, I have been on a path towards finding a
solid career (that pays better than "struggling musician"). This motivation has driven me to earn 
my master's degree in music technology, it has driven me to teach myself how to code, and 
ultimately through my current position as a full stack developer at Hedvig, a cutting-edge 
software-defined storage company. I am now looking for a position in which I can combine
my passion for both music and computer programming.

I am uniquely qualified for the position of Software Development Engineer (Amazon Music) at A2Z 
Development Center, Inc. because I am a musician, a music technologist, and a software engineer. 

I have repeatedly proven my ability to rapidly learn complex new subjects and apply them in 
productive and innovative ways. I recently finished a cluster deployment and management platform for
the entire Hedvig product. I have contributed to and headed projects ranging from client-side 
JavaScript SPAs, to server-side Node.js applications, to DevOps tools written in Python and Ansible. 

Outside of work I have devoted much of my free time to working with C++ for general purpose 
and audio application development and to increase my knowledge and extend my capabilities 
as a developer. I am highly capable in C++, Python, Swift, and JavaScript and have developed 
a strong working knowledge of C, Objective-C, Haskell, Java, Ruby, and Perl. I have studied 
various topics such as computability, systems programming, and concurrency, and put considerable 
effort towards internalizing modern software development best practices, drawing wisdom from 
object-oriented paradigms, functional paradigms, design patterns, and optimization techniques.

I would like to bring the following strengths to your attention as I feel they closely match the
advertised job requirements:

- Strong foundation in object-oriented design principles, specifically with C++
- Linux DevOps and basic system programming
- Full stack Web development, including work with databases and REST web services
- Experience with various Apache tools, including Thrift RPC
- General knowledge of Amazon S3

Please find attached a copy of my resume which contains additional relevant information.
I can be reached by phone at (510) 301-1980 or by email at timothyshull@gmail.com. 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you would like to schedule an interview.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,


Timothy M. Shull, Jr.
