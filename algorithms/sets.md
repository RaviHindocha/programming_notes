## Set APIs (from Algorithms, 4th ed.)
- much like the symbol table APIs but only need the keys as values
- only need:
    - add
    - delete
    - contains
    - empty
    - size
- can add set operations such as
    - union
        - for elem in both lhs and rhs add to tmp set and return tmp
    - intersection
        - create tmp
        - if size of lhs < size of rhs -> for elem in lhs if also in rhs, add to tmp
        - else for elem in rhs, if also in lhs, add to tmp
        - return tmp
    - complement
        - need set containing all elements possible
        - create tmp set
        - for elem in all elements, if not in arg add to tmp
        - return tmp
- can implement using linked list, trees (red-black) (ordered), or hash tables (unordered)
- can have set or multiset
- commonly used for filter clients i.e. whitelist or blacklist, or deduplication

- specifies information about subsets and proper subets
- defines set intersection, union, and difference
