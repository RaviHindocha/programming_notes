# Chapter 1 - Preliminaries
## Advantages of GDB
- faster startup
- enables remote SSH debugging
- can manage multiple debugging sessions at once
- may need to debug GUI program without a GUI
- many additional features

## General steps
- compile
```
gcc -g -Wall -o output_exe input_file.c
```
- *codesign GDB - https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/macmingweclipse/allexperimental/mac-gdb-install.html
- gdb exe -tui
- *call `directory` once started to add directory of exe and debug symbols
- commands
```
run <prog args>
print <var name -> in scope> (p)
break <line num> (b)
condition <break point num> <condition -> var=val etc>
break <line num> if <condition>
run (r)
next (n)
list (l)
continue (c)
disp (d)
step (s)
bt -> backtrace
set <var = val>
call <function>
clear <break point number>
```
- stay in gdb while recompiling
- can use a startup file with gdb commands (~/.gdbinit)
```
gdb -command=z x
```

# Chapter 2 - Stopping to Take a Look Around
- symbolic debugger relies on debug symbols to link machine instructions
  to source code
## Pause
- breakpoint - pause at a location
- watchpoint - pause when a memory location (or related expression) changes value
- catchpoint - pause when an event occurs

## Breakpoints
- assigns numbers to breakpoints
- list breakpoints:
```
info breakpoints
```
- remove breakpoints:
```
delete <breakpoint num>
```
- to create:
```
break <function>
break <line_number>
break <filename:line_number>
break <filename:function>
break <+offset or -offset> - ahead or behind current execution point
break <*address> - used for programs without debug info

tbreak -> temporary breakpoint
hbreak -> hardware assisted breakpoint
thbreak -> temporary hardware assisted breakpoint
rbreak -> sets breakpoints at start of any function matching a regular expression

catch -> triggered by things like thrown exceptions, caught exceptions, signals, calls to fork(),
         loading and unloading of libraries, and other events
```

- working with multiple files (best to create Makefile):
```
gcc -g3 -Wall -Wextra -c main.c swapper.c
gcc -o swap main.o swapper.o
```
- gdb has an idea of a focus, starts on file with main
- list code in a function
```
list <func name>
```
- breakpoints may move between edits and recompiles

## Deleting breakpoints
```
delete <breakpoint_list>
delete -> deletes all
clear -> clears the breakpoint at the next instruction (use when stopped at a breakpoint)
clear <function>
clear <filename:function>
clear <line_number>
clear <filename:line_number>
```

## Disabling breakpoints
```
disable <break num(s)>
enable <break num(s)>
```

## Info about breakpoints
```
info breakpoints
Identifier - num
Type - breakpoint, catchpoint, watchpoint
Disposition - keep, del, dis (keep, delete after next encounter, discard after next)
Enable status - enabled or disabled
Address
Location - line in source code and file
```

## Continuing execution
- next and step
```
n
s
```
- continue execution
```
continue
continue <num> -> ignores next n breakpoints
```
- continue to end of current stack frame
```
finish (fin)
```
- continue execution through current loop
```
until (u)
until <breakpoint arguments>
```

## Conditional Breakpoints
- see pg 82 for more examples
```
break <break args> if <condition>
```
- can use int returning functions also
- to use non-int returning functions
```
set $p = (double (*) (double)) cos
ptype $p
p cos(3.14159265)
p $p(3.14159265)
```

## Breakpoint Command Lists
- used to execute sets of commands after a breakpoint is reached
```
commands <breakpoint number>
<commands>
end
```
- any valid gdb expression, including library functions or functions
  within the executable can be used

## Watchpoints
- pause when an expression changes value
```
watch <var> -> i.e. watch i
watch <expression> -> i.e. watch (i | j > 12) && i > 24 && strlen(name) > 6
```
- displayed with info as a hardware watchpoint

## Expressions
- can be:
    - gdb convenience variables
    - any in-scope var from the running program
    - any kind of string, numerical, or character constant
    - pre-processor macros (must be compiled to include pre-processor) info
    - conditionals, function calls, casts, and operators defined by the language youâ€™re using
- NOTE: the manual says compiling with preprocessor debug info is not
  possible but can be done with `-g3`


# Chapter 3 - Inspecting and Setting Variables
- print
```
p <var> -> can include member/function access, index access, pointer dereference, etc
```
- display -> automatically print an item at each pause in execution
```
disp <var>
```
- also helpful to use the commands command with printf, etc
- use the call command within the commands function
```
e.g.
commands <break num>
<command>
call function(args)
end
```

- printing a stack array
```
p <array>
```
- will not work with dynamic arrays, which can be solved two ways:
    - p <*pointer@number_of_elements>
    - p (int [25) *x -> print with a specific cast

## C++ considerations
- most commands work the same but with different output
- cannot inspect class types with any built ins but can review structure
```
ptype <var>
```

## Examining memory
```
x <location>
```

## Advanced print and display options
```
p/x <var> -> print hex
dis disp 1 -> temporarily disables display items
enable disp 1 ->
undisp 1 -> delete a display item
```

## Setting variables
```
set x = 12
set args <args> -> sets command line arguments
```

## GDB's variables
- $ and $<num> - value history variables
- $<name> - convenience variables
- names can be almost anything except $<num> and $<register name>
- can access registers with $<register name>


# Chapter 4 - When a Program Crashes
## Memory Management
- most common crash -> illegal memory access
    - seg fault on unix-like platforms
    - general protection fault on Windows
    - occurs when hardware supports virtual memory and it must be in use
- VM layout
    - unix generalization
        - .text
            - instructions generated from code
            - includes statically linked code
        - .data
            - global and static variables
        - .bss
            - uninitialized global and static variables
        - heap
        - unused
        - stack
        - env
        - *dynamically linked code is included somewhere depending on platform
    - can view process memory layout on linux by viewing /proc/<PID>/maps file
- memory pages
    - defaults to 4096 on Pentium (older)
    - OS maintains a page table -> each process entries with
        - physical location of page on disk
        - permissions of page
    - no partial pages allocated
- page table accesses for running processes
    - global static variable access requires r/w access of data section
    - local variable access requires stack r/w access
    - function enter/exit requires stack access
    - malloc/new requires heap access
    - machine instructions require text section access

- TODO: more here
## Core files
- gcc -g -W -Wall <file>.c -o <outname>
- objdump -s core-file
- gdb <executable> <core-file> or gdb <executable> -c <core-file>
- gdb --args ./crash -p param1 -o param2

- creation
    - contains description of program's state when it died
        - contents of stack (or stacks for each thread)
        - CPU register contents
        - values of statically allocated and global variables
- overriding shell suppression
    - bash `ulimit -c unlimited` or size (`ulimit -c` to check)
    - tcsh/csh `limit coredumpsize 1000000`

- don't leave gdb while making code changes during debugging

# Chapter 5 - Debugging in a Multiple-Activities Context
## Client/Server Network Programs
- very complex debugging topic
- not mentioned but can use remote debugging
## Debugging Threaded Code
```
compile with -lpthread -lm (link pthread and math libraries)
```
- interrupt with ctrl-C
- inspect threads
```
info threads
```
- switch threads
```
thread <thread num>
```
- break in a thread
```
break <break info> thread <thread num>
```
## Debugging Parallel Applications
- shared memory and message passing
- attach to a running process
```
gdb <proc name> <proc num>
```
- info after attach
```
bt (backtrace)
```
- backtrace options
```
// stop with ctrl-c
bt <n> -> print innermost n frames
bt full -> print values of local variables
bt no-filters
bt no-filters full -> no python frame filters
// see https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Backtrace.html for more
```
- print current stack frame
```
frame (f)

info frame
info frame <address>
info args
info locals
```
### Shared-Memory Systems
- OpenMP is popular and often uses threads
- TODO: more info and research here -> software-distributed shared memory (p 170)
- OpenMP is essentially C with OpenMP directives
- uses the omni compiler to compile (http://www.hpcc.jp/Omni/)
- hooks in with preprocessor directives and uses OpenMP library code
- after that use many of the same thread debug techniques

# Chapter 6 - Special Topics
## Common issues
- phantom line numbers in syntax error messages
- missing libraries
```
// compile with
-l<lib name> -> same as lib88.a

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/Debug/z
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

// may need to set pkgconfig path
// in C or TC shell
setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```
- debugging gui programs
     - curses ->

# Chapter 7 - Other Tools
- use strace:
    - logs all system calls made by a program
- use ltrace:
    - logs all library calls made by the program

- splint -> static C secure code checking linter
- EFence -> dynamic memory checker
- GNU MALLOC_CHECK_ environment variable -> set 0 - 3
- GNU mcheck/mtrace function -> include mcheck.h, call mcheck/mtrace before heap functions
