# 2. Strategies for a Great Interview
## Approaching the problem
- clarify the question
- work on concrete examples
- spell out the brute force solution
- apply patterns

## Presenting the solution
- use libraries if possible
- focus on the top-level algorithm
- manage the whiteboard
- assume valid inputs
- test for corner cases
- check syntax
- check memory management (especially in C and C++)
- remember the interviewer cannot process a large amount of code
    - keep your solution simple if possible

## Know your interviewers and the company

## General conversation
- can the candidate clearly communicate a complex idea?
- is the candidate passionate about his/her work?
- is there a potential interest match with some project?

## Other advice
- be honest
- keep a positive spirit
- don't apologize
- keep money and perks out of the interview
- appearance
- be aware of your body language

## Stress interviews
- may inject stress into situation to test candidate (especially in finance industry)
- testing to see how interviewee responds
    - do not fall apart
    - do not allow yourself to become belligerent
    - do not allow yourself to be easily swayed

## Learning from bad outcomes

## Negotiating an offer
- stick to email
- try to speak directly with hiring manager
- remember that long term career is more important than compensation


# 3. Conducting an Interview
## Objective
- determine if candidate will be a successful employee
- do not be indecisive about candidate - this wastes interview
- turn candidate into brand ambassador for recruiting
- make interviewee feel positive about experience and company

## What to ask
- how much training time does the work environment allow?
- for startups
    - can make sense to test on domain specific knowledge
- for larger organizations
    - data structures
    - algorithms
    - system design
    - problem solving techniques
- remember to choose problems that
    - have no single point of failure - do not ask a single question based around a single insight
    - have multiple possible solutions
    - cover multiple areas
    - calibrate on the problems that will be covered by colleagues
    - do not require unnecessary domain knowledge

## Conducting the interview
- prepare hints beforehand
- watch for
    - a candidate that get stuck
    - a verbose candidate
    - an overconfident candidate

## Scoring and reporting

### Primitive Data Types
- types
    - char
    - int
    - double
    - unsigned and long variant
- types differ among languages
    - Java has no unsigned int
    - int width is machine and compiler dependent in C
- example problems
    - find set bits in int
        - use x & ~(x - 1)
    - right propagate the rightmost set bit
    - x modulo a power of 2
    - check if power of 2
- remember to use lookup tables of nibbles

### Arrays
- maps indexes in range 0 to n - 1 to objects of a given type (n is number of objects in array)
- lookup and replacement is constant time
- many common errors exist
    - bounds/fence errors
    - sizeof errors
- example problems
    - partitioning (related to quicksort)
        - maintain two regions on either end of array and expand one element at a time

### Strings
- generally a character array
- many common operations are generally not used for arrays
    - comparison
    - joining
    - splitting
    - substring search
    - replacement
    - parsing
- example problems
    - look-and-say

### Lists
- collection of values (implicitly ordered by relationship between elements) which may include repetitions
- generally collection of nodes
    - singly-linked
    - doubly-linked
- often used as components of larger data structures
- example problems
    - zip of a list

### Stacks and queues
- stack - LIFO
- queue - FIFO
- example problems
    - reverse polish notation
    - parsing
    - order of evaluation

### Binary trees
- search trees - keys in a sorted order via hierarchical relationship
- commonly node-based
- example problems
    - process/system resource locking

### Heaps (aka priority queue)
- based on binary tree
- each element has a priority associated with it and delete removes element with highest priority
- min and max variants
- example problems
    - merging separate stock trade transactions sorted by timestamp
        - trivial when working with heaps

### Hash tables
- used for storing keys (and optionally values)
- O(1) (on average)
    - inserts
    - deletes
    - lookups
- requires
    - a good hash function
    - resizing in certain cases
        - may result in O(n) updates
- example problems
    - check if string can be permuted into palindrome
        - if and only if characters occur only twice with an optional single character
    - check for plagiarism
        - suffix arrays in hash table form

### Binary search trees
- used to store comparable objects
    - nodes satisfy BST property, e.g. left children are null or less than, right children are null or greater than
- log n
    - lookup
    - insertion
    - deletion
- supported by balanced types (AVL and red-black)

### Algorithm patterns
- analysis patterns
    - concrete examples
        - manually solve concrete instances of the problem and then build a general solution
    - case-analysis
        - split the input/execution into a number of cases and solve each case in isolation
    - iterative refinement
        - find brute force solution and improve upon it
    - reduction
        - use a well-known solution to some other related problem as a subroutine
    - graph modeling
        - describe the problem as a graph and use graph algorithm to solve
- algorithm design patterns
    - sorting
        - uncover structure of problem by sorting input
    - recursion
        - if input is structured in recursive pattern, design recursive algorithm to follow
    - divide-and-conquer
        - divide into two or more independent subproblems and solve original using subproblem solutions
    - dynamic programming
        - compute and cache solutions to smaller subproblems and solve original using subproblem solutions
    - greedy algorithms
        - compute in stages making choices at each stage that are locally optimal
    - invariants
        - identify invariant and use it to remove potential solutions that are suboptimal or contained within
          other solutions

### Intractability
- some problems may not have an efficient solution
- must prove intractability
- NP complete
    - must be NP and NP-hard
    - NP
        - nondeterministic polynomial time
    - NP-hard
        - at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP
        - a problem H is NP-hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H
            - assuming a solution for H takes 1 unit time, we can use Hâ€Ž's solution to solve L in polynomial time
        - finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP-hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all
          the problems in NP, which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard
