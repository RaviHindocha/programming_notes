# 1. The Python Data Model

## How Special Methods Are Used
- meant to be called by Python interpreter and not programmer
- can be used to emulate numeric types with operator overloading
- can be used to set how a custom type is printed (__repr__)
    - __str__ is called by the str() constructor and implicitly used by the print function
    - __str__ should return a string suitable for display to end users
    - choose __repr__ if only implementing one because when no custom __str__ is available Python will call __repr__ as
      a fallback
- can be used for arithmetic operators (__add__, __mul__)
- can be used to use custom type as a bool value (__bool__)

- len is not called as a method because it gets special treatment as part of the Python data model, just like abs
- can also make len work with custom objects using the special method __len__

- special methods allow custom objects to behave like the built-in types
    - enables the expressive coding style the community considers Pythonic
- A basic requirement for a Python object is to provide usable string representations of itself, one used for debugging
  and logging, another for presentation to end users
    - purpose of special methods __repr__ and __str__ exist in the data model
- emulating sequences is one of the most widely used applications of the special methods
- Python offers a rich selection of numeric types, aided by operator overloading, from the built-ins to
  decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction, all supporting infix arithmetic operators

- Python data model - used in documentation
    - Python object model - used by many authors
- the Ruby community calls their equivalent of the special methods magic methods.
- the term metaobject protocol is useful to think about the Python data model and similar features in other languages
- metaobject refers to the objects that are the building blocks of the language itself
- in this context, protocol is a synonym of interface
- metaobject protocol ~= object model - an API for core language constructs.
- aspect-oriented programming is much easier to implement in a dynamic language like Python, and several frameworks
  do it, but the most important is zope.interface




# II. Data Structures

# 2. An Array of Sequences
- mastering the standard library sequence types is a prerequisite for writing concise, effective, and idiomatic Python code

## Overview of Built-In Sequences
- mutable
    - list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque, and memoryview
- immutable
    - tuple, str, and bytes
- flat sequences
    - str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, and array.array hold items of one type
    - physically store the value of each item within its own memory space, and not as distinct objects
    - more compact, faster, and easier to use
    - limited to storing atomic data such as numbers, characters, and bytes
- container sequences
    - list, tuple, and collections.deque can hold items of different types
    - hold references to the objects they contain, which may be of any type
    - more flexible
    - act surprisingly when they hold mutable objects
    - use with caution with nested data structures

```
Container       Iterable        Sized
__contains__    __iter__        __len__

^               ^               ^
Sequence
__getitem__
__contains__
__iter__
__reversed__
index
count

^
MutableSequence
__setitem__
__delitem__
insert
append
reverse
extend
pop
remove
__iadd__
```

## List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions
- powerful notations to build and initialize sequences, master them
- listcomps and genexps
```
for symbol in symbols:
    codes.append(ord(symbol))

codes = [ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols]
```
- syntax tip - in Python code, line breaks are ignored inside pairs of [], {}, or ()
    - can build multiline lists, listcomps, genexps, dictionaries and the like without using the ugly \ line
      continuation escape
- in Python 2.x, variables assigned in the for clauses in list comprehensions were set in
  the surrounding scope
    - the value of outer variables can be overwritten
- prefer listcomps over builtin map and filter
    - may be faster in some cases but not always
    - test
- to initialize tuples, arrays, and other types of sequences can use listcomp
    - genexp saves memory because it yields items one by one using the iterator protocol instead
      of building a whole list just to feed another constructor
- use the same syntax as listcomps, but are enclosed in parentheses rather than brackets
```
tuple( ord( symbol) for symbol in symbols)
```

## Tuples Are Not Just Immutable Lists
- tuples in Python play two roles
    - records with unnamed fields
    - immutable lists
- when a tuple is used as a record, tuple unpacking is the safest, most readable way of getting at the fields
- the new * syntax makes tuple unpacking even better by making it easier to ignore some fields and to deal with
  optional fields
- can use tuple unpacking with any iterable
    - tuple unpacking -> iterable unpacking
```
a, b, *rest = range( 5)
(0, 1, [2, 3, 4])
```
- can use nested tuple unpacking
```
for name, cc, pop, (latitude, longitude) in metro_areas:
```
- named tuples
    - like tuples, they have very little overhead per instance
    - provide convenient access to the fields by name and a handy ._asdict() to export the record as an OrderedDict.

- tuples as immutable lists
    - tuple supports all list methods that do not support adding or removing items
        - except __reverse__ but reversed(my_tuple) works without it
    - __add__
    - __iadd__
    - append
    - clear
    - __contains__
    - copy
    - count
    - __delitem__
    - extend
    - __getitem__
    - __getnewargs__
    - index
    - insert
    - __iter__
    - __len__
    - __mul__
    - __imul__
    - __rmul__
    - pop
    - remove
    - reverse
    - __reversed__
    - __setitem__
    - sort

## Slicing
- sequence slicing is a favorite Python syntax feature, and it is even more powerful than many realize
- multidimensional slicing and ellipsis (...) notation, as used in NumPy, may also be supported by user-defined sequences
- assigning to slices is a very expressive way of editing mutable sequences
- repeated concatenation as in seq * n is convenient and, with care, can be used to initialize lists of lists containing
  immutable items

## Using + and * with Sequences

## Augmented Assignment with Sequences
- augmented assignment with + = and *= behaves differently for mutable and immutable sequences
    - *= - these operators necessarily build new sequences
    - if the target sequence is mutable, it is usually changed in place â€” but not always, depending on how the sequence
      is implemented

## list.sort and the sorted Built-In Functions
- the sort method and the sorted built-in function are easy to use and flexible, thanks to the key optional argument
  they accept, with a function to calculate the ordering criterion
- key can also be used with the min and max built-in functions

## Managing Ordered Sequences with bisect
- to keep a sorted sequence in order, always insert items into it using bisect.insort; to search it efficiently, use
  bisect.bisect

## When a List Is Not the Answer
- Python standard library provides array.array.
- NumPy and SciPy are not part of the standard library but should study
- thread-safe collections.deque
    - comparing its API with that of list in Table Â  2-3 and mentioning other queue implementations in the standard
      library

# 3. Dictionaries and Sets
- Python dicts are highly optimized
- hash tables are the engines behind Pythonâ€™s high-performance dicts

## Generic Mapping Types
- collections.abc
    - Mapping
    - MutableMapping
    - formalize the interfaces of dict
- often extend collections.UserDict instead
```
Container       Iterable        Sized
__contains__    __iter__        __len__

^               ^               ^
Mapping
__getitem__
__contains__
__eq__
__ne__
get
items
values

^
MutableMapping
__setitem__
__delitem__
clear
pop
popitem
setdefault
update
```
- keys must be hashable
    - an object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime
      (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method)
    - hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value
    - the atomic immutable types (str, bytes, numeric types) are all hashable
    - a frozenset is always hashable, because its elements must be hashable by definition
    - a tuple is hashable only if all its items are hashable

## dict Comprehensions
- dictcomp added in Python 2.7
```
country_code = {country: code for code, country in DIAL_CODES}
```

## Overview of Common Mapping Methods
- defaultdict and OrderedDict in collections
    - clear
    - __contains__
    - copy
    - __copy__
    - default_factory
    - __delitem__
    - fromkeys
    - get
    - __getitem__
    - items
    - __iter__
    - keys
    - __len__
    - __missing__
    - move_to_end
    - pop
    - popitem
    - __reversed__
    - setdefault
    - __setitem__
    - update
    - values

### Handling Missing Keys with setdefault
- dict access with `d[k]` raises an error when k is not an existing key
- d.get(k, default) is an alternative to `d[k]` whenever a default value is more convenient
  than handling KeyError
- when updating the value found (if it is mutable), using either __getitem__ or get is
  awkward and inefficient
```
my_dict.setdefault(key, []).append(new_value)

# same as
if key not in my_dict:
    my_dict[key] = []
my_dict[ key]. append( new_value)
```
- setdefault uses a single lookup whereas the second example uses at least two and three
  if its not found
